# NLP
developed a simple context word prediction model using n-grams in Python. Tokenized text, created n-gram pairs, calculated probability distributions, and predicted the next word based on context. While effective for basic tasks, more sophisticated models like RNNs or transformers are often required for capturing complex language patterns.
